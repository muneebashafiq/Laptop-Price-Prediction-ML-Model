# Laptop-Price-Prediction-ML-Model
This project predicts laptop prices based on a comprehensive dataset containing features such as brand, processor specifications, RAM, storage, and operating system. It employs machine learning techniques to develop regression models for accurate price estimation.

**Key Objectives**
- **Data Exploration:** Analyze and understand the dataset to identify key trends and insights relevant to predicting laptop prices.
- **Feature Engineering:** Engineer new features and preprocess existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the models.
- **Model Selection and Training:** Implement and train regression models such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Regressor to predict laptop prices accurately.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of trained models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess their effectiveness in price prediction.

**Technologies Used**
- Programming Languages: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Machine Learning Models: Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
